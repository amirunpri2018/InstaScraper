jasmean317,"I am INSPIRED and MOTIVATED by my own mother to do yoga. She started at 50 and by 2 years, she has become a certified instructor with six-pack, greater stamina than many fit guys and the flexibility like a gymnast. I saw how her body and mind changed. So i do yoga because of that and amazingly, it is a medicine to my spine and my overall health. It relaxes me; strengthens me, stretches me. I can say that yoga is the best and my most favorite workout. @tkt.krittiya @yokrangsima @praewander @surira_k @piawnaldo @foofoofunfun",6,5,True
