I can work out with the Fitbit Charge 3, which gives me progress updates during my workout and lets me know when I reach my goal. My favourite sport is cycling. We can play a part to reduce our carbon emissions from transport. I choose to walk for short journeys or cycle to and fro from my home to the nearest MRT station. It’s a good way to exercise too. 🚴🚵🚶@su.knh @waltzrocket @mustuckin @koalamilk08 @adielaridzuan @farahanimrazak @nabillaammara @nuramirah11 @nuramidyna @eslimah #fit",10,8,True
